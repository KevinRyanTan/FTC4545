Steps:
1. Start on the center of the floor parking zone
2.
3.
4.
5.

Capabilities:
1. Score up to 90 points in the autonomous period.
2. Score up to 60 additional points in the end game.
3. Precisely rotate using the Gyroscopic Sensor
4. Determine the position of the center structure quickly and accurately, with a 
100% success rate.
5. Works quite well with ramp autonomous programs.


Limitations:
1. Ball scoring in the center goal doesn't matter in late game if we fill it up anyways
2. Quite inaccurate, can only handle part of an inch of variance in the field.
3. Not the optimal autonomous for our wheels, as our wheels can shift quite a bit, and this
requires extremely accurate wheels, i.e. stealth wheels.
4. Good chance of running into the opposing alliance.
