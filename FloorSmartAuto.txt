FloorSmartAuto.c Documentation

Steps:
1. Start on the center of the floor parking zone
2. Move forward a bit to measure location of the center structure
3. Determine position of the center structure
4a. If the center structure is in position 3,
5. Move forward
6. Turn right 135 degrees
7. Back up until you latch onto the small goal
8. Drag the small goal forwards
9. Drop the ball in the small goal
10. Turn right 45 degrees
11. Move forward
12. Turn right 135 degrees
13. Back up and let go of the small goal
14. Move forwards to prepare for knocking over the kickstand
15a. In position 3, turn right 45 degrees. Then move forward a bit. Next, turn left 45 degrees
and run into the kickstand
15b. In position 2, move forward. Next, turn right 45 degrees, and finally run into the kickstand.
15c. In position 1, turn right 45 degrees. Then move forward and turn left 135 degrees.
Finally, run into the kickstand.

Capabilities:
1. Score up to 80 points in the autonomous period
2. Has a 90%+ success rate
3. Precisely rotate using the Gyroscopic Sensor
4. Determine the position of the center structure quickly and accurately, with a 100% success rate
5. Able to work well with almost all ramp autonomous programs.

Issues:
1. Some "slip" can occur, making it inaccurate, however, it is the most accurate autonomous
we currently have.
2. It only allows for 80 points
3. Our robot can have difficulty scoring on the small goal
4. In danger of being run into by the opposing alliance.
