FloorSmartAuto.c Documentation

Steps:
1. Start on the center of the floor parking zone
2. Move forward a bit to measure location of the center structure
3. Determine position of the center structure
4a. If the center structure is in position 3, turn around and score in the center goal.
It then goes and grabs onto the center goal, and runs into the kickstand.
4b. 

Capabilities:
1. Score up to 80 points in the autonomous period
2. Has a 90%+ success rate
3. Precisely rotate using the Gyroscopic Sensor
4. Determine the position of the center structure quickly and accurately, with a 100% success rate
5. Able to work well with almost all ramp autonomous programs.

Issues:
1. Some "slip" can occur, making it inaccurate, however, it is the most accurate autonomous
we currently have.
2. It only allows for 80 points
3. Our robot can have difficulty scoring on the small goal
4. In danger of being run into by the opposing alliance.
