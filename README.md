Team 4545's code
Ouroboros

We have our main files that we are working on in this folder, and our old files not in use in the "Not for use at regionals" folder.
We also have all of our drivers, provided by Xander, in the "drivers" folder.
Each of our main files utilize various header files, and each has a description of what the software is able to do.
Soon we will add documentation to each of the header files.
We are currently working to make the code less messy and more ubitiquous, with detailed descriptions of what each method is designed to do.
